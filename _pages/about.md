# üòä About Me

Greetings!üëã
I'm Jianshu Zhang (Âº†Èâ¥ÊÆä), a junior undergraduate student at the [School of Cyber Science and Engineering](http://cse.whu.edu.cn/index.htm), [Wuhan University](https://www.whu.edu.cn/).  Prior to WHU, I spent three years studying at [Shenzhen Middle School](https://www.shenzhong.net/). 
My research interests mainly focus on Large Language Models, Large Mutimodal Models, and Continual Learning 
I‚Äôm open to any possible discussions or collaborate opportunities. If you‚Äôre interested in working with me, don‚Äôt hesitate to drop me an email!
