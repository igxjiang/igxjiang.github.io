# About Me

Hi! I’m **Guangxin Jiang (蒋光鑫)** ,currently a Final year undergraduate student in Huazhong University of Science and Technology(HUST). I am majoring in Biomedical Engineering with a keen interest in microelectrioncs.
Fortunately, I was supervised by Prof. [**Qingguo Xie**](https://sme.ustc.edu.cn/2023/0822/c30996a610384/) and Prof. [**Zhiwei Wang**](http://faculty.hust.edu.cn/WANGZHIWEI/zh_CN/index.htm) during my undergraduate studies.

My research focuses on sensors systems and Analog integreted circuits design.

I’m seeking a PhD position in 2026 fall. In the futher future, I want to be a professor in university.And feel free to reach out to me for discussion!

## Project Experience
- *2024.10-2025.06*: &nbsp; TDC circuits design.  
Participated in the design of the core Time-to-Digital Converter (TDC) module for a novel fully digital monolithic silicon photomultiplier (MT-SiPM). Completed circuit design for pulse rising/falling edge detection, delay control units, and measurement channels, and is currently designing the measurement precision control module. Additionally, proposed a tree-shaped symmetrical routing scheme to address the signal inconsistency in the multi-channel array of PET detectors. This scheme significantly reduces delay differences between channels caused by RC parasitic effects.
Before joining the project team, I also completed scientific research training (primarily on Cadence Virtuoso usage) and ultimately finished the design of an operational amplifier.

- *2024.04-2024.07*: &nbsp; Biomedical signal classification.  
Based on electrocardiogram (ECG) and electroencephalogram (EEG) multimodal data from both depression patients and healthy individuals, Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Convolutional Neural Network-Long Short-Term Memory (CNN-LSTM) models were established. Innovatively proposing the concept of "depressive episode proportion," this approach addresses the issue of imbalanced sample sizes and effectively achieves screening and detection of early-stage depression in adolescents.
