# üòä About Me

Greetings!üëã
I'm Jianshu Zhang (Âº†Èâ¥ÊÆä), a 4th year undergraduate student at the [School of Cyber Science and Engineering](http://cse.whu.edu.cn/index.htm), [Wuhan University](https://www.whu.edu.cn/).  
Prior to WHU, I spent three years studying at [Shenzhen Middle School (Ê∑±Âú≥‰∏≠Â≠¶)](https://www.shenzhong.net/). 

My research interests mainly focus on **Reliable¬†(multimodal) LLMs, Data-centric¬†AI, and Lifelong Learning**. Recently, I‚Äôve started exploring **Reasoning**, focusing on key areas such as multimodal reasoning; longer reasoning and inference time scaling laws; and step-by-step reward mechanisms.

Currently, I'm actively seeking ü§ó 25Fall Ph.D. positions ü§ó to further pursue my research goals. Feel free to connect and discuss exciting opportunities or collaborations!
