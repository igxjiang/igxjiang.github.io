# 🧑‍💻 About Me

Hi! I’m **Jianshu Zhang (张鉴殊)**, a fourth‑year undergraduate at [Wuhan University](https://www.whu.edu.cn/) majoring in Cyber Security. I’ll begin my PhD in Computer Science at **Northwestern University** in Fall 2025, where I hope to build AI systems that are **reliable, multimodal, and adaptable**.

My research so far has focused on

- **Responsible AI** – ensuring ML systems behave safely and fairly;
- **Multimodal AI** – enabling models to connect language, vision, and action;
- **Adaptable AI** – helping models learn continually and personalise on‑device.

I’m always keen to discuss new ideas and collaborations—feel free to reach out!

## 🔍 Research Interests

1. **Safety & Robustness** of large multimodal models (backdoors, alignment).
2. **Explainable Time‑Series Forecasting** (prototype‑based, covariate‑aware).
3. **Embodied Intelligence** (mapping high‑level language to low‑level control).
