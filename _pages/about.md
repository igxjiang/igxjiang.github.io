# About Me

Hi! I’m **Guangxin Jiang (蒋光鑫)** ,currently a Final year undergraduate student in Huazhong University of Science and Technology(HUST). I am majoring in Biomedical Engineering with a keen interest in microelectrioncs.
Fortunately, I was supervised by Prof. [**Qingguo Xie**](https://sme.ustc.edu.cn/2023/0822/c30996a610384/) and Prof. [**Zhiwei Wang**](http://faculty.hust.edu.cn/WANGZHIWEI/zh_CN/index.htm) during my undergraduate studies.

My research focuses on sensors systems and Analog integreted circuits design.

I’m seeking a PhD position in 2026 fall. In the futher future, I want to be a professor in university.And feel free to reach out to me for discussion!
