# About Me

Hi! I‚Äôm **Guangxin‚ÄØJiang (ËíãÂÖâÈë´)** ,currently a Final year undergraduate student in Huazhong University of Science and Technology(HUST). I am majoring in Biomedical Engineering with a keen interest in microelectrioncs.
Fortunately, I was supervised by Prof. [**Qingguo Xie**](https://sme.ustc.edu.cn/2023/0822/c30996a610384/) and Prof. [**Zhiwei Wang**](http://faculty.hust.edu.cn/WANGZHIWEI/zh_CN/index.htm) during my undergraduate studies.

My research focuses on sensors systems and Analog integreted circuits design.

I‚Äôm seeking a PhD position in 2026 fall. In the futher future, I want to be a professor in university.And feel free to reach out to me for discussion!


## News
- *2025.07*: &nbsp; I was selected as **Excellent Camper** by Wastlake Unviersity and ZJU,FDU.ü§ó 
- *2025.05*: &nbsp; I passed the visiting student program of **HKUST** and plan to start in July.
- *2025.03*: &nbsp; I participated in [**ICAC**](https://icacworkshop.cn/) workshop 2025 in Shenzhen.
- *2025.02*: &nbsp; I founded my personal website.
- *2024.11*: &nbsp; I won the **National Scholarship**  (Award Rate: 0.4% national-wide).
- *2024.10*: &nbsp; I joined the [**digital PET lab**](https://petlab.hust.edu.cn/) as undergraduate researcher with the guidance of Prof.Xie and Mr.Zhilong Li.
- *2023.10*: &nbsp; I won the **National Encouraged Scholarship**.

## Project Experience
- *2024.10-2025.06*: &nbsp; TDC circuits design.  
Participated in the design of the core Time-to-Digital Converter (TDC) module for a novel fully digital monolithic silicon photomultiplier (MT-SiPM). Completed circuit design for pulse rising/falling edge detection, delay control units, and measurement channels, and is currently designing the measurement precision control module. Additionally, proposed a tree-shaped symmetrical routing scheme to address the signal inconsistency in the multi-channel array of PET detectors. This scheme significantly reduces delay differences between channels caused by RC parasitic effects.
Before joining the project team, I also completed scientific research training (primarily on Cadence Virtuoso usage) and ultimately finished the design of an operational amplifier.

- *2024.04-2024.07*: &nbsp; Biomedical signal classification.  
Based on electrocardiogram (ECG) and electroencephalogram (EEG) multimodal data from both depression patients and healthy individuals, Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Convolutional Neural Network-Long Short-Term Memory (CNN-LSTM) models were established. Innovatively proposing the concept of "depressive episode proportion," this approach addresses the issue of imbalanced sample sizes and effectively achieves screening and detection of early-stage depression in adolescents.
